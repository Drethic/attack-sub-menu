# Drethic's Attack Sub Menu Plugin for RPG Maker MV

## Usage

This plugin will allow you to have custom attack menus that override the main
attack and skills menu items.

1. Create the Skill Types you want to use for your menu items
2. Assign your skills the appropriate Skill Types
3. Add your Skill Types to either the Classes or Actors
4. Add your Skills to either the Classes or Actors

If you add more than one Skill Type to a Class/Actor the names will be alphabatized
in descending order.

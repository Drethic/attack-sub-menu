# Drethic's Attack Sub Menu Plugin for RPG Maker MV

## Usage

This plugin will allow you to have custom attack menus that override the main
attack and skills menu items.

1. Create the Skill Types you want to use for your menu items
2. Assign your skills the appropriate Skill Types
3. Add your Skill Types to either the Classes or Actors
4. Add your Skills to either the Classes or Actors

If you add more than one Skill Type to a Class/Actor the names will be alphabatized
in descending order.

## Terms of Use

Any original material made by Drethic is free for use with both free and commercial RPG Maker games unless specified otherwise. I do not demand royalties or special liberties if you choose to use Drethic original content in your commercial games. (Although a free copy of your game would be nice!) I only ask that you provide Drethic a spot in your game’s credits.

Any edits made to Drethic original material are okay as long as you still provide the proper credit. Any non-Original content posted, linked, or shared on my website and channel will still require you to contact the respective parties for permission of use.

I think this is simple. I’d like to keep it simple. I ask of you, as users, to please do not do things that will make me complicate it for everyone.

Happy RPG Making!
